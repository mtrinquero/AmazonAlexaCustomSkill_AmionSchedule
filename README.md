# Amazon Alexa Custom Skill for accessing Amion Schedule Data

## custom amazon alexa skill designed to access hospital schedule data from Amion's external API.  
Would allow for Medical Professionals (Doctors, Nurses, etc) to ask Alexa when their next shift is, who's working with them, 
and other meaningful datapoints such as Location, "Team", etc. Initial idea for this project came from family members working at Northwestern's emergency medicine department
